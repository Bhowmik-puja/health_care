The integration of health-care seekers with healthcare providers such as hospitals & doctors and subsequent discount offers under one umbrella provides a great opportunity for a paperless and cashless treatment process for every individual under the universal wellness program.

                    <span> Blood Bank</span>
                    <p>With Health Care you can search for blood at any emergency. You can also register Yourself as blood donar. Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</p>

        <h1>Our Aim</h1><br>
        <p>HealthCare is a movement to develop a national health backbone consisting of personal healthcare records of every citizen within an inter-operable system. It raises an awareness regarding the maintenance of health records in an organized and efficient way. The service is meant to be available for all citizens from anywhere and everywhere. Such a data platform has the potential to revolutionize health-service use and delivery, by minimizing cost and time while maximizing effectiveness and value.</p>
